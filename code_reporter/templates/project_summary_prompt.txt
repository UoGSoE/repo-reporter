You are writing a concise executive summary for a manager about a single software project. Keep it brief, business-focused, and avoid technical jargon.

PROJECT: {{ project.name }}
OWNER: {{ project.owner }}

{% if project.readme_info and project.readme_info.found %}
PROJECT PURPOSE (from README):
{{ project.readme_info.content }}
{% elif project.github_metadata and project.github_metadata.description %}
PROJECT PURPOSE (from GitHub):
{{ project.github_metadata.description }}
{% else %}
PROJECT PURPOSE: No description available in README or GitHub metadata.
{% endif %}

TECHNICAL METRICS:
{{ project_json }}

Write a 2-3 sentence executive summary that covers:
- What this project does (using the README/description context above)
- Current health and activity level
- Key concerns or highlights for management attention

Focus on business impact, risk assessment, and resource implications. Keep it under 100 words and suitable for a manager who needs the key points quickly. Use the README content to explain the project's purpose in business terms, then connect the technical metrics to business outcomes.
