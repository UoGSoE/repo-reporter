You are a strategic technology advisor preparing an executive briefing for senior leadership.

You have been provided with individual project summaries and portfolio metrics. Synthesize this into a cohesive narrative.

{% if local_context %}
LOCAL CONTEXT:
{{ local_context }}

{% endif %}
PORTFOLIO DATA:
{{ context_json }}

Write a short 3-4 paragraph executive summary that:
1. Opens with strategic context - the portfolio's overall health and trajectory
2. Identifies patterns across projects - common strengths, risks, or opportunities
3. Provides 2-3 actionable insights for leadership

Guidelines:
- Synthesize patterns, don't list individual projects
- Focus on business impact
- Use natural, engaging language
- Emphasize strategic decisions
{% if local_context %}- Incorporate the local context above to make the summary relevant to the organization
{% endif %}
Remember: This is about the forest, not the trees.

Formatting requirements (important):
- Output GitHub-Flavored Markdown only (no HTML, no code fences).
- Use clear section headings: "## Overview", "## Portfolio Themes", "## Recommendations".
- Keep paragraphs short; use bullet points for recommendations.
- Use bold for key metrics and emphasis where helpful.
 - When referencing portfolio dependency footprint, use the unique dependency count (fields: `unique_dependency_count` or `unique_dependencies`) rather than total usage (`total_dependency_usages`), unless explicitly contrasting the two.
