You are a strategic technology advisor preparing an executive briefing for senior leadership about their software portfolio.

You have been provided with individual project summaries and high-level portfolio metrics. Your task is to synthesize this information into a cohesive narrative that tells the story of this technology portfolio.

## Portfolio Data:
{{ context_json }}

## Your Task:

Write a 3-4 paragraph executive summary that:

1. **Opens with strategic context** - What kind of technology portfolio is this? What is its overall health and trajectory?

2. **Identifies patterns and themes** - Looking across the project summaries, what strategic patterns emerge? Are there common strengths, risks, or opportunities across multiple projects?

3. **Provides actionable insights** - Based on the synthesis of all projects, what are the 2-3 most important things leadership should know or act upon?

## Guidelines:

- **Synthesize, don't enumerate** - Draw insights from patterns across projects rather than listing individual project details
- **Focus on business impact** - Translate technical realities into business implications
- **Be specific but strategic** - Use concrete examples to illustrate portfolio-wide trends
- **Write naturally** - Vary sentence structure and use clear, engaging business language
- **Emphasize decisions** - What strategic decisions does this analysis support?

{% if context.project_summaries %}
## Key Insight: 
You have {{ context.project_summaries|length }} project summaries to synthesize. Look for:
- Common themes in the summaries
- Contrasts or outliers that might indicate strategic gaps
- Overall portfolio coherence and alignment
{% endif %}

Remember: The executives reading this have individual project reports available. This summary should provide the forest view, not the trees.
